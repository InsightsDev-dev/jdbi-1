= Generated Keys

Inserts and related queries may automatically generate keys.  These keys are
treated separately from normal results.  Depending on your database and configuration,
the entire inserted row may be available.

WARNING: Unfortunately there is a lot of variation between databases supporting 
this feature so please test this feature's interaction with your database thoroughly.

In PostgreSQL, the entire row is available, so you can immediately
map your inserted names back to full User objects!  This avoids the
overhead of separately querying after the insert completes.

Consider the following table:

[source,java,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------
include::GeneratedKeysTest.java[tags=setup]
-------------------------------------------

You can get generated keys in the fluent style:

[source,java,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------
include::GeneratedKeysTest.java[tags=fluent]
-------------------------------------------

SqlObject style works just as well:

[source,java,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------
include::GeneratedKeysTest.java[tags=sqlObject]
-------------------------------------------
